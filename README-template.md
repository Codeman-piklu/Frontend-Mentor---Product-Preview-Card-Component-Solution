## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts: Fraunces and Montserrat
### What I learned
Working on this project allowed me to:

Gain confidence using CSS Grid for flexible layouts:
- css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  align-items: stretch;
}

- Experiment with hover effects to enhance interactivity:

button:hover {
  box-shadow: 5px 2px 15px rgb(41, 27, 2);
}

Focus on responsive design principles for better usability across devices.
### Continued development
For future projects, I plan to:
- Further explore advanced CSS animations.
- Work on responsive typography techniques.
- Integrate accessibility best practices, including ARIA roles and semantic improvements.
### Useful resources
- MDN Web Docs - For reliable documentation and examples of HTML and CSS.
- CSS Tricks - A valuable resource for design patterns and CSS techniques.
- Google Fonts - For incorporating beautiful typography into designs.
